                The Idea of Open Source
                              
                Everyday we run systems that run on servers and cloud, which are again dependent on base systems, CPUs, GPUs that run tirelessly. While all these systems exist, has anyone ever wondered how these base systems really came into existence in the first place? It all started with the first portable operating system, Unix. 
                You hear about it everywhere, where you go. You open a Wikipedia page on Linux, you find `Unix-based`. You read about Apple's MacOS, you'll see that `its core parts includes a Unix system`. 
                But did you know that it was originally non-portable and meant to be a convenient platform for programmers. It was never meant for non-programmers. 
                However, as more end-users began adding their own tools and shared it in their academic circles, Unix systems gained immense popularity. It was after this, where Unix was made more user-friendly.                
                People modified these systems, invented their own tools for research purposes. These systems were shared with their colleagues and this opened their imagination to the possibility of modifying and designing their machines. 
                

                
                As Steve Jobs says </p>
                
                <p class="quote">"Great things in business are never done by one person; they’re done by a team of people"</p>
                 
                <p class="page-content">
                After all, a <strong style="color:#ff764d">community</strong> is what <i style="color:#5488e8">sustains</i> development. The presence and support of open-minded enthusiasts who will devote their time and knowledge. This is the one of the pillars of the Open Source software movement.

                <p class="page-content">
                One of the core definitions of open-source software is the freedom to study, run, edit and redistribute the source code of the software.
                This inspires developers to create their own software and share their knowledge. In fact, the Open Source Initiative was inspired by the open sourcing of Netscape Navigator, which later went on to inspire the creation of the Firefox browser. 
                Let me list 3 things that open source does well: </p>
                
                
                <p class="page-content">
                **Transparency** - When you open-source a project, you encourage transparency. Transparency is essential for an organisation. During an election, would you willingly vote for a candidate who does not disclose their intentions or goals? Mozilla’s reputation increased greatly after they open sourced their products. You will find Firefox in any Linux distro you pick.
                
                <br><br>**Reduced costs and Improved Quality** - Take the case of Google Chrome. By not having to pay large internal teams for development costs, they were able to focus their resources on specific areas. Developers from various backgrounds inspected the code, allowing them to identify vulnerabilities and fix the patches quickly. Open-sourcing their products allowed a huge community to work on and implement various plugins, themes and features. This made the products highly scalable and adaptable.
               
                <br><br>**Attracting and Retaining Talent** - Linux is the open source project with the biggest community in the world, and their greatest supporter is Red Hat. They foster a heavy sense of community internally and within the open source ecosystem. They invest significant amount of resources in the employee training and development. Red Hat encourages remote-work and offers competitive pay. They care about their employees, who work on projects that affects millions of lives and changes the world. In fact their distro, Fedora, is one of the most popular Linux distros ever. Red Hat is not the only organization that supports open-source projects. There’s Google (Android OSP), AWS, IBM, JetBrains, Docker, NASA.

                <p class="page-content" style="font-style: italic;">
                
                - Learn to Google. ACTUALLY. This is such an under-rated skill today. People think that they have the answer the moment they get access to a device and internet. It is important to know how to search effectively.<br>
                - Read the licenses of the software you use, interpret them carefully & choose them wisely - many times what we students end up doing is, (for our term projects) we do `git clone` and present that. There wouldn’t be any license in those repositories that you copy the code from, BUT this copying of code is liable to legal action. Unless the creator provides a license telling that you have the right to modify and redistribute it, you really shouldn’t do it. If you do it, at least make sure that you clarify your intentions and acknowledge the creators in your license or `readme file`.<br>
                - Start out small - build libraries in a language of your choice and think about the practicality of your creation. How will this make the devs’ work simpler? How can they install and integrate them in their projects? Will it cause any dependency clashes?<br>
                - If you wish to take a step further, try building your own products. Software or tools that you will use in your everyday life. It can be something as simple as your own to-do list application. When we take this step, we try to avoid all the bugs and test it vigorously. This allows us to put ourselves in the shoes of the mass producers who have to cater to the needs to millions of people across the globe.<br>
                - When you develop something, CREATE PROPER DOCUMENTATION. The documentation is the most useful reference material for its uses available. This is where developers have to ensure that they give proper examples and demonstrations.</p>
